For the fun of it and as example for workshop, I turn the Mega2560 into a monster.

Composed of four different type of relay, it allows with integer from HC06 to set them on and off.

I am using all the Analog (0-16) as reading with audio jack (Red, While, Green Black).
I am using digit from (2-12) as read with audio jack (Red Black).

Outside of the teaching workshop, the aim is to have a bridge to remote control the RC Exost car and provide Drone joysticks at low cost.

As the aim is to teach, Keyboard.h and Mouse.h is added to it.
